## 🚀 **Project Workflow**  

### **1️⃣ Data Collection & Preprocessing (Python 🐍)**  
✔ **Loaded the dataset** and handled missing values & duplicates  
✔ **Formatted timestamps** to extract useful time-based insights  
✔ **Engineered new features** such as:  
   - **Listening Duration:** Total time spent per track  
   - **Completion Rate:** Percentage of tracks fully played  
   - **Skip Rate:** Identifying least engaging tracks  
   - **Exploration vs. Loyalty Score:** Differentiating new vs. repeated artists  

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Python 🧐)**  
✔ Analyzed **listening behavior trends, device usage, artist preferences, and seasonal variations**  
✔ Identified **correlations between playtime and external factors (time of day, weekends, etc.)**  

### **3️⃣ Data Visualization & Dashboard Creation (Power BI 📊)**  
✔ Designed an **interactive dashboard** featuring:  
   - **Listening Trends Over Time (Line Chart)**  
   - **Most Played Tracks (Bar Chart)**  
   - **Top Artists by Playtime (Bar Chart)**  
   - **Peak Listening Hours (Heatmap)**  
   - **User Exploration vs. Loyalty (Pie Chart)**  
✔ Implemented **drill-through features** for deeper insights
